# oil_skimmer# oil_skimmer
  The project uses image processing for detecting oil on
  the surface of water surface A camera mounted over the bot
  captures images which are then passed to a trained
   neural network. This network then classifies whether the
  image consists of oil or not. As soon as oil is detected it
  moves towards the oil. When the bot reaches the oil, the
  conveyor belt starts moving, thus skimming the oil.
